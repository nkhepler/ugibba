25 scaffolds recovered during BLAST searches

3 distinct portions of scaffold 00016 returned BLAST results.
	first two look bona fide
	third is only 1 BLAST hit and can't find anything exp-like in
	translation. calling it junk and not including.

2 exps on scaffold 00033
	pretty close but couldn't build single consensus. needed 2.

3 distinct blast hits on scaffold 00041
	similar to 00016: 2 are bona fide exps, third is not

scf00260 exp looks a little weird. maybe missing a piece near beginning.

28 so far



scf00260 predicted to have 2 different splice variants (despite one being all one open reading frame). not sure which is 'better'

scf00318 missing start codon but full exp appears there
	saved AUGUSTUS output from original and from one that i removed STOP from what
	looks like signal peptide


Summary:
28 unique expansion-like genes identified. Scf00318 is annotated with a stop codon in signal peptide. I removed this and named Scf00318_edited. Scf00260 has a extremely divergent domain 1 region but domain 2 looks more like an expansin. Built a tree based on D2 (NJ only) for seeing where 260 branches. Did not include 260 in full-length EXPA tree.
